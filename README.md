> ## CAP1 - The Problem
> <p>The Robotic's project has been in place for 6 years at SESI DF schools in the region. Inside it, students are engaged to building robots, carrying out research projects and even building miniature formula 1 cars. <br>
> However, the enrollment process for students interested in joining the teams is not automated and depends on external servers. Considering this problem and understanding that teams also need a means of advertising to acquire sponsorships, the Robotics SESI website was created as a possible solution.</p>
